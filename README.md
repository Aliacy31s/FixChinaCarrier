This is a Magisk module to solve the APN problem of the slow speed of China carrier in some roms.
## How to use?
Just install it in Magisk Manager.

**Note:The apns-conf.xml of different roms may be in different locations, but I know a little of Shell, so I can't write a script to select location automatically. As a result, you need to manually check your location and select the correct module on the Releases page.**
## How it works?
Replace the apns-conf.xml of your rom with MIUI's.
